# Restrict Navigation

A plugin for OJS 3.3x to restrinct the Backend navigation: only the Site Admin can see and operate in the "Tools" and "Settings" sections.

Within the Settings form, you can choose to restrict the backend only for the "Tools" and/or "Workflow" and/or "General Settings" (everything under "Settings" except for "Workflow") submenus.
